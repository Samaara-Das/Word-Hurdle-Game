# Word Hurdle Game

It's a word-guessing game where players have 6 tries to identify a five-letter word. After each guess, red colored letters indicate which letters are not present in the target word and green colored letters represent the letters that are part of the target word. Players use this feedback to solve the puzzle efficiently.
